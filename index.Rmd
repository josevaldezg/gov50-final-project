## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the results of the National Assessments (Pruebas Nacionales) of the Dominican Republic. Every year the Ministry of Education conducts these examinations nationwide, which every student is required to take to graduate from High School. This data is useful to better understand how students are performing in the different subjects (Spanish, Math, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences). Also, exploring this data might tell us how students are performing in the different regions, and the differences in performance between schooling methods (private, public, technical, arts, etc).
